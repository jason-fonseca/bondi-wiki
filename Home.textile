Bondi is the execution environment for New World Order processing.

It is primarily a Javascript engine provided by the "Mozilla Spidermonkey Project":http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/. It also makes use of Sqlite3:http://www.sqlite.org/, Libcurl:http://curl.haxx.se/, OpenSSL:http://www.openssl.org/, zlib:http://www.zlib.org/ and iconv:http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the heavier lifting.

It is similar in nature to ASP Classic from Microsoft but provides only an interpreted Javascript environment and definitely does not make it easy to intermingle output and code!
