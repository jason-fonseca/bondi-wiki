h2(#summary). Summary

Instrinsic object available in [[Bondi|Bondi Reference]]

h2(#description). Description

h2(#properties). Properties

- ProcessId (read-only) := The process id (or pid) of the running bondi instance.
- ProcessName := The process name of the running bondi instance, can be changed.

h2(#properties). Methods

- Exit := If the bondi process is running in a process pool - calling Exit will signal that the controlling daemon should shut down the entire pool. NOTE: the currently executing script will continue to completion after Application.Exit(); returns - use Response.End(); to stop the script.

All environment variables available at process startup are present as properties on the Application object.

Additionally, you can add properties here that will persist beyond page execution.

h2(#examples). Examples

```javascript
// Grab the process id and name
var pid = Application.ProcessId;
var pname = Application.ProcessName;

// Change the process name to something else, this will be reflected in the external OS environment
Application.ProcessName = "supercoolprocessname";

// List of all properties as well as environment variables and values
for (var x in Application)
{
	Response.Write("Application['" + x + "']: " + Application[x]);
}
```
