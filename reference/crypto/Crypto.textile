h2(#methods). Methods

- Decrypt(method, key, iv, data [, padding]) := Takes an encryption method (eg. "AES", "DES"), key, initialization vector, data to decrypt and optionally the padding mode (either "ZERO", "PKCS7", "ANSIX923" or "ISO10126"), returns decrypted data.
- DecryptAndVerify(method, key, iv, data [, padding]) := Takes an encryption method and hash (eg. "AES-MD5", "DES-SHA1"), key, initialization vector, data to decrypt and verify and optionally the padding mode (as above for Decrypt), returns decrypted and verified data.
- Encrypt(method, key, iv, data [, padding]) := Takes an encryption method (eg. "AES", "DES"), key, initialization vector, data to encrypt and optionally the padding mode (as above for Decrypt), returns encrypted data.
- EncryptAndSign(method, key, iv, data [, padding]) := Takes an encryption method and hash (eg. "AES-MD5", "DES-SHA1"), key, initialization vector, data to encrypt and sign and optionally the padding mode (as above for Decrypt), returns encrypted and signed data.
- Hash(method, data) := Takes a hash method (eg. "MD5", "SHA1") and data, returns a cryptographic hash value of the data.
- Hash(method, key, data) := Used for MAC (message authentication code) checking, takes a hash method (eg. "MD5", "SHA1"), key and data, returns a MAC (message authentication code) that can be used to compare.
- Key() := Converts a string of bytes into a key that can be used in the encrypt and decrypt functions that will ensure the key is not hashed to convert a key to the correct size for the requested algorithm.
- Random (number of bytes) := Returns the request number of cryptographically random bytes.
- Sign()
- Verify()
